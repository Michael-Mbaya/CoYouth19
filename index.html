      <h1 id="About">About Us</h1>
      <p><b>What is CoYouth19?</b> Well if you ask. CoYouth19 is a Youth Campaign consisting of youths 
                    from Pipeline estate and those from nearby areas with the 2 objecives of: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Provide the Public with Correct Information about Covid-19 and the Corona Virus.
                   This is to eliminate the false information being spread around. </li>
              <li>Outreach Programs to help the needy amongst our communities with essential basic
                   needs alonside the first objective.</li>
            </ol>
      <p>CoYouth19 is a youth campaign initiative started by yours truly <b><em>Michael Mbaya Gikunda</em></b>
          , a young resident of the busy Pipeline Estate in Nairobi city. Starting with a small group of 
          friends and neighbors, the initiative has reached out to a wider network of around <em>500</em> 
           young people in the estate and neighboring communities. Soon it became a force for good in our surrounding
          communities. The recent Covid-19 Pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organisation (W.H.O), has hit 
        the whole world by storm. This effect has reched our country too as well and has not spared any of us
        The economy has taken a hit for the worse, especially the low-to-middle income neighborhoods. With this in mind, we 
        have set out to also help the needy and unfortunate people among our communities</p>
      <p>Measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have disrupted informal labour markets and led to significant income loss 
        for many low-income households. Few will have the financial resources to weather this storm, let alone provide additional
         care for loved ones in need. This is the moment for helping those less fortunate than ourselves</p>
      <p>In Patnership with other NGO's and Private Patners we help the needy and also affected during this Pandemic.</p>

         of the spikes on their cell membranes. The spikes look like crowns. <em>'Corona'</em> is latin for crown.

          acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)</p>

          The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However we now 
          simply just call it 'Coronavirus' globally.

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Infection with the new coronavirus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The virus appears to spread easily among people, and more 
          continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads from person 
          to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by 
          respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can
           be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.</p> <p>It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, 
            nose or eyes, although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.</p>
        <p>Since it is passed from person to person, one can also get it from the following modes of Contact with an infected Person: </p>
            <ol class="info-list">
              <li>Kissing and Hugs with infected Persons</li>
              <li>Sharing of common utilities with infected Persons</li>
              <li>Oral Sex with an Infected Person</li>
            </ol>
      </div>
      
      <div class="info-col" id="info-2">
